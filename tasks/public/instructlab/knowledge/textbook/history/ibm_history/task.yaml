  - answer: Thomas J. Watson's vision and leadership strategies had a profound
      impact on IBM's growth and corporate culture. He envisioned a unified
      company with a strong culture, focused on the tabulating machine, and
      de-emphasized less promising technologies. Under his leadership, IBM
      doubled its revenue within four years, expanded internationally, and later
      rebranded as International Business Machines in 1924. Watson instilled
      philosophies of globalism, equal pay for equal work, and the imperative to
      always "think," which remain core to IBM's identity.
    question: How did Thomas J. Watson's vision and leadership strategies impact
      IBM's growth and corporate culture?
  - answer: " D) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman who
      facilitated the merger of the International Time Recording Company, the
      Computing Scale Company, and the Tabulating Machine Company in 1911, while
      Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as general manager
      in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on the tabulating
      machine and expanding operations internationally."
    question: >
      Which of the following statements accurately describes the role of

      Charles Ranlett Flint and Thomas J. Watson in the formation and early

      success of IBM? 

      A) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman

      who founded the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (later IBM) in

      1911, while Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as

      general manager in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on

      the tabulating machine and expanding operations internationally.


      B) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman who founded the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (later IBM) in 1911 and served as its president, while Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as a branch manager at the National Cash Register and later became a manager at C-T-R.


      C) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman who founded the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (later IBM) in 1911 and served as its CEO, while Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as general manager in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on the tabulating machine and expanding operations internationally.


      D) Charles Ranlett Flint was a financier and businessman who facilitated the merger of the International Time Recording Company, the Computing Scale Company, and the Tabulating Machine Company in 1911, while Thomas J. Watson was a salesman who joined the company as general manager in 1914 and later became president, focusing resources on the tabulating machine and expanding operations internationally.
  - answer:
      After its formation, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company faced
      significant debt and resistance from managers of the merged companies who
      were resentful of the merger and resisted full integration. To overcome
      these challenges, Charles Flint recognized the need for a uniting force
      and a charismatic leader, leading to the hiring of Thomas J. Watson as
      general manager, who later became president and refocused the company
      towards success.
    question: Describe the challenges the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
      faced shortly after its formation and how these were overcome.
