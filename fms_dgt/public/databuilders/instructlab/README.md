# Skills and Knowledge SDG Pipelines

These databuilders are an implementation of the LAB method described in [Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1]

Disclaimer:

- These databuilders are inspired by InstructLab's Skills and Knowledge SDG pipelines but may differ in some aspects
- These databuilders are for demonstrative purposes only and therefore we have not performed any comparative analysis with InstructLab's implementation
- We last checked for consistency with InstructLab's implementation in October 2024, so some details might have changed since then
